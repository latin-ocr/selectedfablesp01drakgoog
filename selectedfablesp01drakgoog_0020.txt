xii Introduction

some critics, differing in style. Now Book ll and Book V
the regular text are much shorter than the others, and in
Prologue to Book I the author apologizes ior allowing trees
talk in his lables, an apology that seems unnecessary, since th
is no instance of such an occurrence ln the collection that
have. Furthermore‚ Fables XIII and XIV of Book lV ,
manifestly incomplete. From these facts, it is believed that
the manuscript to which Perotti had acoess in making his coll
tion, there were fables which have not come down to us throu
other channels, and in modern editions of Phaedrus these fab
are usually added to the five books that are known to belong
this author.

The anticipation of posthumous same so halvely expressed
Phaedrus has not been realized to the extent that the autl
hoped, though he might, if Ilving, be content with the reputati
oi being the only Latin fabulist of the classic period. His sau
as wellas his virtues are those oi a little mind. His lack
judgment and failure to see clearly the true meaning ol t
lables, shown particularly in their application and their unskill
variations from the Greek originals, are not less marked th
the clearness with which he brings situations before his readd
and the finish in form oi some oi his sables.

His verse is iambic trimeter or senarius of the form

u-U-v..w-v-t)!

The last foot is always an iambus or pyrrhic. ln the otherft
we may have, instead of an iambus ι -
(1) The spondee (- ..)‚ most commonly in the fifth foot.

(2) The anapaest (v υ -),particularly in the first and fil
soot, never two in succession. ,

(3) The dactyl (- υ υ), oitenest in the first, third, al
fourth foot.

(4) The tribrach (υ υ υ), never in such a position that
word ends with it.

(5) The proceleusmaticus (υ υ υ υ), only at the beginnir

ol a verse. ς
