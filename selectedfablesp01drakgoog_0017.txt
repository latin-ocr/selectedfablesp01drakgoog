Tun Greeks referred the fables commonly current among them
to Aesop, who was believed to have lived abou't the middle of the
sixth century before Christ. The first mention of him in Greek
literature (Herodotus Il, 134,135) indicates that in the time
of the historian little was known about Aesop's personality.
Herodotus says that the grandson of ladmon of Samos claimed
the money offered by the Delphians as indemnity for the death
of Aesop. According to later versions of the tradition to which
Herodotus here refers, Aesop having been freed by his master,
ladmou of Samos, wassent by Croesus to Delphi with four
minae for each one of the inhabitants of that city. But he
quarreled with the citizens about the distribution of the gift
and was killed by them. Plagues having been sent upon the
Delphians because of their crime, they were told by the oracle
to offer an indemnity for the murder of the fabulist, which,
Herodotus tells us, was claimed by the grandson of Aesop's
former master. The later stories concerning the excessive ugli·

= ness of Aesop are supposed to have arisen from a false derivation ’
of his name from αἰσχρός and ὥψ.

As there isso little known about Aesop, and so much told that

ἲ is evidently false, many have thought that his actual existence
was a myth3 and that the fables like the sagas of the North,
Ξ were a slow growth in the history of literature, which gradually
cameto be attributed to an individual who never really existed.
Certainly many of the fables ascribed to Aesop could never have
been written by him3 though this does not prove that there was

not such a writer of fables in existence in the sixth century
