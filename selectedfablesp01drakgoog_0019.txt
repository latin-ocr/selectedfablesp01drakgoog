Introduction xi

Ἴ tus. To explain the long silence of the poet between Book ΙΙ
and Book 111, it has been surmised that Sejanus, prime min-
ister of Tiberius, was made angry by something in the first two
books. it may have been by the very pertinent application of
the moral of Pable VI, in Book Ι, to the matrimonial designs
r oi this imperial favorite upon Livia, wife of DrusuS, the son of
Tiberius. Whatever may have been the cause, the literary
activity of Phaedrus was completely repressed until after the
death of Sejanus and his imperial master.

ln the Prologue to Book Ι, Phaedrus modestiy says that he
simply aims to transfer the fables of Aesop into Latin verse for
the double purpose of amusing and instructing his readers, but
in the second book he begins to incorporate matter of his own1
with that of his Greek model, and in the following books this
tendency is still more strongly marked. Many of these additions
¹ are to be classed as anecdoteS, rather than as fables in the strict
sense of that term. About one-third of the fables are manifestly
Greek in origin, and as many more may have been drawn from
Greek sources not now accessible. But there remains stilla
considerable number that are distinctively Roman.

We have the direct testimony of Ανίειηιιε,2 who lived in the
fourth century, that Phaedrus published only five books of fables‚
but in most editions we find other fables added, either as a sixth
book or as an appendix. The reason for this is as follows: In
the fifteenth century, Niccolo Perotti, - late in life archbishop of
siponto—when a young man, made a collection of sables for
the benefit of his nephew. In this collection, along with a
number of fables found in the five books of Phaedrus, are thirty
in the same meter as those of Phaedrus, though, according to

Verum has pro exemplo fabulas et Socrates divinis operibus indidit et
poematis suis Flaccus aptavit, quod in se sub iocorum communium specie
vitae argumenta contineant. Quod Graecis iambis Babrius repetens in duo
volumina coartavit, Phaedrus etiam partem aliquam quinque in libellos
resolvit
