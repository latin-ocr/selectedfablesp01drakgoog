i bekept in mindz- ·
i dein is always a monosyllable.
i detitde is always a dissyllable.
l diutius, not diutins, is regularly used.

i e'runt in the perfect is osten erunt.

³ illius Ι, 14, 8, but illius ΙΙΙ, Prol. 38.
i substantivas in ius and aiem sometimes retain and sometimes
ξ drop the second i in the genitive singular.
t tuchercule and mehercules are always trisyllables, pronounced
3 me'rcule and mercule's.
¹ miluus is always a trisyllable.
ne'scio is sometimes a dissyllable.
¹ quoniam is always a trisyllable.
Other variations Peculiar to the passages in which they occur
are mentioned in the notes.
lt is taken sor granted that the student knows that final i in
mihi, tibi, sthi, and ubi, which is commonly short, may some-
times be long, and that final o of the first person singular of the
verb, commonly long, may sometimes be short.
