PREFACE

-οοο-

Trrts selection ol lables has been prepared for use in reading
stin aloud and, its natural concomitant, reading without a
ctionary. The quantities have been marked rather than the
cents, in the belief that better results in reading aloud canbe
ached by observing carelully the length of the vowels‚ than
r attempting to follow mechanically the rhythmos the verse.
or the same practical reason, it is suggested that the teacher
llow Lucian Mueller's theory of the structure of the Latin
trse,¹ remembering that the principle os quantity was the only
re taken into account, and that the prose accent was neglected
the reading of poetry. Whatever may be said soror against
is theory from the scientific point of vieW, it seems to furnish
,e' best pedagogical solution of the much discussed problem of
e relation of metrical ictus and prose accent.

The lew notes given with the text are such as Ι have
und by actual trial had to be supplied to a class, composed
ainly of sophomores and juniors in the University ol Michigan‚
ho had prepared their lessons without the aid ol a lexicon or
reabulary. From the lact that the Latin is so simple, the book
ay be made useful in the high school course, by substituting it
rsome part of the regular work. The marked quantities will
ake easy the drill in reading aloud, so often neglected, in our
gh senous, much to the detriment ol the pupils.
