before Christ. Those fables that show interna] evidence of not
having been written by him may be explained as interpolations
of a later time Cert' tam it is that by the close of the fift h tceutury
before Christ, Aesop was firmly est tablished ast t‘he patron saint
offable' among the Greeks. Por a full discussion olthis ques· l
tion, see Welcker ‘Aesop eine Fabel,’ in Kl. Sehr ΙΙ, 228ff,
cited by von Christ m lwan Miillers‘ Handbuch der Klassischen
Altertumswissenschaft,’ Vll, S. 1223 and, particularly, W. G.
Rutherford's ‘Rubrius' Introduction, Chap. ll, ‘The History of
Greek Fable.³

The original version of the fables of Aesop was in prose.
Socrates is said to have turned some of these into elegiae verse
during his imprisonment. Demetrius of Phaleron arranged a
collection of Aesop's lables in prose, which was afterward fol·
lowed by other Greek fabulists. These prose fables have not
come down to our times, but are known to us through the
poetical versions of Phaedrus, Babrius, and Avianus. The sev-
eral versions in prose now extant are a product of later times.

Phaedrus, who introduced the fables of Aesop into Latin liter· y
ature in metrica] form, is mentioned once by Martial (Epig. 111, ζ
20, 5)3 by other contemporary authors, not at all. We must,
therefore, depend for our knowledge of his life and character, ᾗ
upon what he himself tells us in the prologues and epilogues to
the several books of his fables. Born in Pieria in Macedonia, Ἴ
he came to Rome as a slave, early in life, received his freedom
from Augustus or TiberiuS, and during the reign of the latter,
published the first two books of his fables. The third book was
dedicated to a freedman of Gaius Caesar or Claudius, Eutychus
by name3 the fourth to Particulo‚ a favonte of Claudius The
fifth book was published later' 1n its author's life, which seems tol
have been prolonged to a great age ’

From the title of his work, Phaedri Augusti Liberti Fabula-l
rum Aesopiarum Libri, there' 1s some reason for the drfference of
opihion that exist s as to the identity of his patronus, though' rt
is very probable that the Augustus referred to is Octavianus,
since Tiberius is usually called Caesar Tiberius, and not Augus-
